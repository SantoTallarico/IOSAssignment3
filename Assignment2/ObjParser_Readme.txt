This is a command line application written in C.
It is a product of the tutorial found here:
                 https://www.raywenderlich.com/48293/how-to-export-blender-models-to-opengl-es-part-1

OBJs MUST be exported from Blender with the settings
-include Normals
-include UVs
-Triangulate Faces

and will not function with other additions unless modified. I take no credit for the techniques described in the tutorial.
